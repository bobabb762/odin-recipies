	Project Website for a recipe book
	In this project I created a basic website for recipes. 
	Originally I created a homepage and some titled pages to 		link to.
	Secondly I searched the internet for some recipies of tasty 		sounding dinners.
	I put an image on the homepage that links to the correct 		recipe page which contains instructions to cook the dish 		and ingredients needed to do so. 
	Lastly I committed my changes to git and pushed it through 		to github.

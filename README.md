# odin-recipies
Project Website for a recipe book
In this project I created a basic website for recipes. 
Originally I created a homepage and some titled pages to link to.
Secondly I searched the internet for some recipies of tasty sounding dinners.
I put an image on the homepage that links to the correct recipe page which contains instructions to cook the dish and ingredients needed to do so. 
Lastly I committed my changes to git and pushed it through to github.
